  <h1>About Humanism</h1>

  <section class="summary">
    <h2>Are You a Humanist?</h2>
    Ask yourself:
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Do you think people can be good without religion?</li>
      <li>✅ Do you believe in reason, compassion, and science to guide our choices?</li>
      <li>✅ Do you value human dignity, equality, and freedom of thought?</li>
      <li>✅ Do you believe we create meaning in our lives?</li>
    </ul>
    Humanists believe:
    <ul>
      <li>✨ People, not gods, shape our future.</li>
      <li>✨ Ethics should be rooted in empathy and reason.</li>
      <li>✨ Everyone deserves dignity, rights, and freedom.</li>
      <li>✨ Life’s meaning is created through our connections, actions, and creativity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why T&T Needs Humanism</h2>
    <p>Despite our nation’s constitutional commitment to equality, non-religious people in Trinidad & Tobago often face social and institutional bias. Religion is embedded in policymaking, public institutions, and even everyday interactions, creating an environment where openly expressing secular or non-theistic beliefs can lead to stigma or exclusion. Remarkably, a blasphemy law from 1844 remains on the books in Trinidad & Tobago. The Humanists TT organisation exists to challenge this imbalance—not by opposing religion, but by advocating for a society where belief and non-belief are equally respected in law, policy, and social norms.</p>
    <p>We promote science- and research-based action instead of relying on dogma or prayer. Humanism addresses societal challenges such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Childhood marriages</li>
      <li>Anti-vaccination and anti-science sentiment</li>
      <li>Lack of sex education and access to contraception</li>
      <li>Anti-LGBTQ policies</li>
      <li>Religious influence in governance</li>
      <li>Gender inequality, corporal punishment, and pro-death penalty policies</li>
      <li>Restrictive laws on abortion, euthanasia, and stem cell research</li>
      <li>Indoctrination versus critical thinking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our goal: a secular, ethical, and inclusive society where all individuals are treated with dignity and fairness.</p>

    <h2>Philosophy of Humanism</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reason and Critical Thinking: Humanism values evidence-based thinking, logic, and rational inquiry to understand the world and make decisions.</li>
      <li>Ethics and Compassion: Morality comes from empathy and consideration for human well-being, not from supernatural authority.</li>
      <li>Human Flourishing: Humanists aim to create conditions where all people can thrive, emphasizing personal growth, education, and self-realization.</li>
      <li>Secular Governance: Public policies should be guided by reason, science, and universal human rights, rather than religious dogma.</li>
      <li>Equality and Justice: Humanism advocates for fairness, inclusion, and protection of marginalized communities.</li>
      <li>Scientific Curiosity: Humanists support scientific inquiry and education as tools to understand reality and solve societal challenges.</li>
      <li>Community and Cooperation: While respecting individual freedom, humanists value collaboration and social responsibility to improve society.</li>
      <li>Celebration of Life: Humanism encourages celebrating life’s milestones—birth, marriage, achievements, and death—in meaningful, secular ways.</li>
    </ul>
